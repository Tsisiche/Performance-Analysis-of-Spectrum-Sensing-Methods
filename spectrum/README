Spectrum sensing methods
========================

Contents of this repository:

 - record.py

    Python script for performing experiments. To run, use

    $ python record.py <experiment>

    Run without an argument to list available experiments.

    Results are written into out/ subdirectory.

    This script assumes a tmpfs mounted under /tmp/mem. tmpfs is used
    for temporary files from GNU Radio to avoid buffer overflows. If you
    have a fast enough hard drive, you can change the TMPDIR value at
    the top of the source to some other path.


 - sensing/methods.py

    Python module with implementations of several spectrum sensing
    methods.


 - sensing/signals.py

    Python module with test signals that can be programmed into a
    Rohde&Schwarz vector signal generator.


 - measurements/

    Results of measurements using USRP, VESNA SNE-ISMTV-UHF and
    simulation.


  - analysis/

    Several IPython notebooks with descriptions of experiments and
    analyses of measurements.
